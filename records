Examples of public enterprises in Nigeria are Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) and Public Educational Institutions. So, if the government sets up a company to provide electricity for the people, that company is a public enterprise.","1":"STI stands for sexually transmitted infection. It is an infection you can get by having sex with someone who has an infection. So, it is important to always use protection, such as a condom, during sex to prevent the spread of STIs.","2":"A musical director\/vocal coach is in charge of selecting relevant music for a film\u2019s production. They work closely with the director and the rest of the production team to ensure that the music fits the tone and style of the production. They also work with the actors to help them with their singing and vocal performances. So, if you ever find yourself in a drama production and you hear some great music, you can thank the musical director\/vocal coach for that!","3":"On the fifth day, God created birds, water, and animals. It's amazing to think that all the different kinds of animals we see today were created by God on that day. Can you imagine how busy God must have been creating all those animals?","4":"When there is conflict in society, it can lead to a breakdown of law and order. This means that people may start to riot, fight, loot, and engage in other forms of lawlessness. This can cause a lot of damage to public and private property, and can even lead to loss of lives. Therefore, it is important to find ways to resolve conflicts peacefully.","5":"The three major types of bones in the hand are Phalanges, Metacarpal bones, and Carpal bones. Phalanges are the 14 bones that are found in the fingers of each hand and also in the toes of each foot. Each finger has 3 phalanges (the distal, middle, and proximal); the thumb only has 2. Metacarpal bones are the 5 bones that compose the middle part of the hand. Carpal bones are the 8 bones that create the wrist. The 2 rows of carpal bones are connected to 2 bones of the arm--the ulna bone and the radius bone.","6":"The largest number mentioned in the text is one trillion. It is mentioned in Example 7 where it is written as 1 000 000 000 000 and read as one trillion. That is a really big number! Can you imagine having one trillion dollars? You could buy so many things with that much money, like a private island or a spaceship!","7":"Data processing involves six stages which are Data Gathering, Data Collation, Input Stage, Processing Stage, Storage Stage, and Output Stage. These stages are important in converting data into useful information.","8":"Neoprene rubber is a type of synthetic rubber that is less susceptible to degrading, corrosion, and burning than most other synthetic and natural rubbers. It is often used as a base material in corrosion-resistant coatings, high-pressure gaskets, belts, and adhesives. Its waterproofing and insulating qualities mean that it is often used for aquatic clothing, gear, and equipment. India rubber and gum rubber are both examples of natural rubber, while latex is the liquid that is collected from rubber trees to make natural rubber.","9":"Scrapers are made of high grade hardened and tempered tool steel. Carbides are sometimes added to the tips to make them last longer. Diamonds and rubies are too expensive to be used as tips for scrapers. Sapphires are not used as tips for scrapers either."},"difficulty":{"0":"hard","1":"easy","2":"medium","3":"hard","4":"easy","5":"medium","6":"medium","7":"easy","8":"hard","9":"hard"}}
